Fun demonstration of programming mixed with one of my hobbies.

Goals: An application that stores drink recipes, flavor profiles, and building instructions

Approach:
  1. Develop a backend service that can store and retreive recipe data in variety of ways
  2. Develop various UI applications with different technologies to showcase

Other Considerations:
  I want to have my recipes be stored in a smart way. For example: Daiquiri is a classic cocktail with many variations. Subrecipes should be of the Daiquiri class but searchible based on what makes them unique. This is where flavor profiles and ingredients will come into play.
